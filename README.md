## PROBLEM 3

Because Sin still feels exceptionally empty, he finally adds another feature to their file system. If a directory is created with the prefix "A_is_a_", it will become a special directory. If a directory is renamed with the prefix "A_is_a_", it will become a special directory. If the encrypted directory is renamed by deleting "A_is_a_" at the beginning of the folder name, that directory becomes a normal directory. Special directories are directories that return encryption/encoding to the "AtoZ_" or "RX_" directories but their respective rules still run in the directory within them ("AtoZ_" and "RX_" recursive properties still run in subdirectories). In the special directory, all filenames (excluding extensions) in the fuse will be changed to lowercase (insensitive) and will be given a new extension in the form of a decimal value from the binary value that comes from the difference in character between filenames. For example, if in the original directory the filename is "FiLe_CoNtoH.txt" then in the fuse it will be "file_contoh.txt.1321". 1321 comes from binary 10100101001.
